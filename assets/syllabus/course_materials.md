## Required Course Materials

There is not textbooks for this seminar.
Links to readings and other online resources will be provided via the course website and/or the Canvas/Perusal.  
Multiple early classes will draw from sections of 
a recent review article, [Statistical Methods for Exoplanet Detection with Radial Velocities](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AnRSA..10..623H/abstract) (Hara & Ford 2023), and 
the [NSF/NASA Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Working Group Final Report](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210714291C/abstract) (Crass et al. 2021).  A version of these and most readings will be freely avaliable online.  However, some assigned readings may be in journals that require logging in with your Penn State account to access.

Whenever practical, students are encouraged to read, comment, and ask questions via Perusall (following link from within course webpage in Canvas).  
Therefore, students will also need a computer, modern web browser and high-speed internet access, so students can submit reading questions and comments (and perhaps effectively participate in any classes that get moved to Zoom).
If you're traveling some weeks and find it's easier to read offline or a print version, then you may submit questions via email (with Astro 589 in subject line).
