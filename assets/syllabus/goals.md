## Course Overview
Students will learn about the current state-of-the-art of Extremely Precise Radial Velocity (EPRV) exoplanet surveys, including observational and data analysis techniques for detecting and characterizing extrasolar planetary systems.  

## Course Goals
Successful students in the class will:
- Understand how extremely precise radial velocity (EPRV) surveys detect and characterize extrasolar planetary systems,
- Identify areas where the current state-of-the-art falls short of what is needed to detect and characterize Earth-analogs, and 
- Increase their skills for digesting journal articles and communicating advanced scientific concepts.

## Learning Objectives
Successful students in the class will:
- Describe how EPRV surveys detect and characterize extrasolar planetary systems.
- Explain the effects of exoplanets, astrophysical variability, and instrumental effects on EPRV observations.
- Compare characteristics of EPRV exoplanet surveys being conducted by Penn State researchers and to those of other current/upcoming EPRV surveys. 
- Critically evaluate the quality of exoplanet detections and mass and orbit measurements.
- Plan and lead effective in-class discussion(s) of topics relevant to EPRV surveys.
