### Readings & Reading Questions/Comments
Students will be expected to read assignments related to each class 24 hours before class stars, so they are prepared to participate in class discussions and discussion leader has time to review their comments and questions.  
Any students who are reluctant to ask questions in class are especially encouraged to submit extra reading comments/questions prior to class.  
Each student's three lowest reading scores will be dropped, no questions asked, so as to avoid having to provide documentation for the vast majority of illnesses, religous holidays, and life challenges.
Any students absent due to an extended illness can still earn full credit for reading questions and class participation for the classes that they need to miss by submitting particularly thoughtful reading questions and comments.

Perusal assigns reading grades based on an algorithm that includes several factors:  number, length, timeliness, and it's perception of quality of posts, opening the assignment in Perusal, reading the entire document in Perusal, time spent engaging with reading in Perusal, extent to which comments elicit responses from other students, and upvoting of other student's comments.  
We'll start with their algorithm, but the instructor may make adjustments to the grading system based on their evaluation of how well it is working.  
The instructor may override Perusal's suggested grades to assign students higher scores when deemed appropriate.
