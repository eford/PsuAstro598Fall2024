## Expected Student Preparation

This class assumes that students have a strong knowledge of calculus, calculus-based mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and the fundamental techniques of optical astronomy.  
In most cases, students will have completed or be enrolled in ASTRO 501 and ASTRO 502.  
Any student who is interested in the class and will not have completed or be taking 501 & 502, should consult with the instructor before starting the class.
