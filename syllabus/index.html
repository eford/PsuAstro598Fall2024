<p>This class assumes that students have a strong knowledge of calculus, calculus-based mechanics, electricity and magnetism, and the fundamental techniques of optical astronomy.   In most cases, students will have completed or be enrolled in ASTRO 501 and ASTRO 502.   Any student who is interested in the class and will not have completed or be taking 501 &amp; 502, should consult with the instructor before starting the class.  
<h2 id="course_content_structure"><a href="#course_content_structure" class="header-anchor">Course Content &amp; Structure</a></h2></p>
<p>The instructor will lead discussions for the first few weeks.   Subsequently, students will lead discussions on a relevant topic, drawing from one to two sources agreed up on with the instructor, and with feedback provided by the instructor. <br/></p>

<p><br/> The schedule is subject to change. 
<h2 id="required_course_materials"><a href="#required_course_materials" class="header-anchor">Required Course Materials</a></h2></p>
<p>There is not textbooks for this seminar. Links to readings and other online resources will be provided via the course website and/or the Canvas/Perusal.   Multiple early classes will draw from sections of  a recent review article, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AnRSA..10..623H/abstract">Statistical Methods for Exoplanet Detection with Radial Velocities</a> &#40;Hara &amp; Ford 2023&#41;, and  the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210714291C/abstract">NSF/NASA Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Working Group Final Report</a> &#40;Crass et al. 2021&#41;.  A version of these and most readings will be freely avaliable online.  However, some assigned readings may be in journals that require logging in with your Penn State account to access. <br/></p>
<p>Whenever practical, students are encouraged to read, comment, and ask questions via Perusall &#40;following link from within course webpage in Canvas&#41;.   Therefore, students will also need a computer, modern web browser and high-speed internet access, so students can submit reading questions and comments &#40;and perhaps effectively participate in any classes that get moved to Zoom&#41;. If you&#39;re traveling some weeks and find it&#39;s easier to read offline or a print version, then you may submit questions via email &#40;with Astro 589 in subject line&#41;.
<h2 id="assessment_and_grading_policy"><a href="#assessment_and_grading_policy" class="header-anchor">Assessment and Grading Policy</a></h2>
<p>Assessment will be in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Class participation: 40&#37; </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reading questions &amp; comments</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-class participation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Student-led Presentation &amp; Discussion:  60&#37;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preparation:  20&#37;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="readings_reading_questionscomments"><a href="#readings_reading_questionscomments" class="header-anchor">Readings &amp; Reading Questions/Comments</a></h3></p>
<p>Students will be expected to read assignments related to each class 24 hours before class stars, so they are prepared to participate in class discussions and discussion leader has time to review their comments and questions.   Any students who are reluctant to ask questions in class are especially encouraged to submit extra reading comments/questions prior to class.   Each student&#39;s three lowest reading scores will be dropped, no questions asked, so as to avoid having to provide documentation for the vast majority of illnesses, religous holidays, and life challenges. Any students absent due to an extended illness can still earn full credit for reading questions and class participation for the classes that they need to miss by submitting particularly thoughtful reading questions and comments. <br/></p>
<p>Perusal assigns reading grades based on an algorithm that includes several factors:  number, length, timeliness, and it&#39;s perception of quality of posts, opening the assignment in Perusal, reading the entire document in Perusal, time spent engaging with reading in Perusal, extent to which comments elicit responses from other students, and upvoting of other student&#39;s comments.   We&#39;ll start with their algorithm, but the instructor may make adjustments to the grading system based on their evaluation of how well it is working.   The instructor may override Perusal&#39;s suggested grades to assign students higher scores when deemed appropriate.
<h3 id="student-led_presentation_discussion"><a href="#student-led_presentation_discussion" class="header-anchor">Student-led Presentation &amp; Discussion</a></h3></p>
<p>The instructor will lead the discussion for the first few weeks.  For future classes one or two students will be assigned to organize and lead the discussion.  During the first week of class, students should select at least three topics that they are interested in presenting and may indicate any dates that they would like to avoid presenting &#40;e.g., travel for research, near another important deadline&#41;.   The instructor will synthesize these inputs and announce the assigned topics and dates during the second week of class. Each student should allocate 15 hours to prepare for the discussion they lead, including thoughtful reading of the assigned reading, reading related sources to gain background knowledge an context, outlining their discussion plans, updating their plans based on instructor feedback, preparing materials to support the discussion they lead, planning questions or activities to stimulate constructive discussions, updating prepared materials and questions based on instructor feedback, reading questions/comments from other students via Perusal, and updating their plans based on student comments. <br/></p>
<p><strong>At least three weeks before their presentation/discussion:</strong>   Student&#40;s&#41; should propose one to three articles that could provide the foundation for their presentation and subsequent discussion.   In the proposal, students should identify what sections of the article&#40;s&#41; they propose assigning prior to class and what sections they propose recommending for reading after class.   The total time required for reading assigned before class and recommended for after class should not exceed one hour.   The instructor may suggest removing or replacing sources, request adding/removing sections assigned, and may require adding one one article of their choosing within one week of receiving a proposal. Provide a link to a PDF version of any readings that can be freely redistributed &#40;e.g., from arXiv&#41; whenever practical, so the instructor can upload it to Perusal. <br/></p>
<p><strong>At least two week before their presentation/discussion:</strong>  Once the primary sources are agreed upon, the student&#40;s&#41; should read the article&#40;s&#41; thoughtfully, prepare an outline for their prepared in-class presentation and intended discussion points, and submit the outline to the instructor.    Submissions may be simple ASCII text, a link to a collaborative document &#40;e.g., Google Doc, Overleaf document&#41;, or a PDF.   A typical outline would include: &#40;1&#41; plan for prepared materials &#40;aim for approximately 15 minutes&#41; that could include background or context &#40;e.g., material from sections not included in the assigned reading&#41; or an explanation of any particularly important concepts/methods/results/figures; and &#40;2&#41; potential questions and/or other prompts/active learning exercises designed to simulate constructive discussion via Perusal and/or during class.   There is an example outline in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H5mFzBSMISdLx6HjuDVBP72CShdfZk6T?usp&#61;sharing">shared google drive folder</a> &#40;link valid for PSU students only&#41;.  Students are encouraged to schedule a time to meet with the instructor after they have had a chance to begin thinking about how to incoporate any feedback and building their presentation materials, so they can ask any questions about their presentation/discussion topics. <br/></p>
<p><strong>Roughly one week before their presentation/discussion &#40;and no later than 9am on the Monday prior to class&#41;:</strong>   Students should submit draft presentation materials via Canvas.  A link to a collaborative document is encouraged, as that facilitates suggestions and replies.  A PDF is also acceptable.    Any presentation prepared in a format that requires special software &#40;e.g., Mac-specific formats&#41; will have to be converted to PDF &#40;or something else that the instructor can easily open&#41;.   Students are also encouraged to add some questions/comments to the assigned reading in Perusal to help jump start discussion among other students. <br/></p>
<p>The above deadlines may be relaxed slightly for the first two student-led discussions, depending on the number of students enrolled and the date of the first student-led discussion. <br/></p>
<p><strong>During the 24 hours prior to the start of the class with their presentation/discussion,</strong> students should review the questions, comments, discussion, and upvotes recorded by students on Perusal.  &#40;If it&#39;s not practical to use Perusal for some article due to copyright issues, then students can collect questions/comments via email instead.&#41;  Then students should consider updating their plans for discussion based on that feedback.  &#40;It&#39;s understandable that graphics added in responce to a question received on Tuesday will not be as polished as those that students started preparing about well in advance.&#41;
<h2 id="academic_integrity"><a href="#academic_integrity" class="header-anchor">Academic Integrity</a></h2></p>
<p>In all assignments submitted and when presenting or leading discussions, all ideas and work derived from resources beyond class notes must properly acknowledge or reference sources, including any use of <a href="https://aiai.psu.edu/">artificial intelligence</a>. <br/></p>
<p>Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.</p>
<p>Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.</p>
<p>All <a href="https://academicintegrity.psu.edu/">Penn State</a>, <a href="https://gradschool.psu.edu/graduate-education-policies/">Graduate School</a>, and <a href="https://science.psu.edu/current-students/advising-and-student-services/integrity">Eberly College of Science</a> policies regarding academic integrity, ethics and honorable behavior apply to this course. <br/>
<h2 id="safety"><a href="#safety" class="header-anchor">Safety</a></h2></p>
<p>While attendance and participation in class is important to the class and your learning, it is more important that we all stay safe and healthy.   Any student who does not feel well or who may be contagious must not attend class in Davey Lab.   If you are staying away from others due to health concerns, then you should let the instruction know in advance of class whenever practical and make plans to get a classmate’s notes for any missed class sessions.   Some class sessions may be moved online, based on community conditions or if the instructor or that week&#39;s presenter needs to quarantine or isolate.   If you are scheduled to present and are unsure if you&#39;ll be recovered in time to present in person, then please let the instructor know as soon as possible, so we can make alternative plans, such as rescheduling or a remote presentation. <br/></p>
<p>All students are required to follow all relevant protocols required or recommended university and government policies in regards to COVID, flu and other infectious illnesses.  University policies and recommendations are subject to change during the semester.  Current recommendations can be accessed at <a href="https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/covidsupport">https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/covidsupport</a>. <br/></p>
<h2 id="recordings_of_classes"><a href="#recordings_of_classes" class="header-anchor">Recordings of classes</a></h2>
<p>Some classes may be recorded. Ay students who prefer to not ask questions while being recorded are encouraged to submit questions in advance of class.</p>
<p>Video and audio recordings of classes are part of the class activities. Any video and audio recordings are used for educational use/purposes and only may be made available to all students presently enrolled in the class. For purposes where the recordings will be used in future class sessions/lectures beyond this class, any type of identifying information will be adequately removed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ad40">University Policy</a>, students must get express permission from their instructor to record class sessions. Screenshots showing instructors and students are considered recordings.
